# django-allauth-skins
Django All Auth Skins for bootstrapping my projects

I use Django-allauth a lot. I end up tweaking the UI for each project I work on. With this, using Material Design via the Materialize CSS Framework, I will only need to fix in the design into any project I work from now with the UI done in a basic, simplistic way.

Will be adding Foundation Zurb and Material Design Lite to the skins later.

## How to use
Assuming you've already added django-alluth to your INSTALLED_APPS
1) Clone this repository
2) Enter each of the skins folder, e.g Materialize
3) Copy all the folders
4) Paste into your app's templates' folder
5) Make neccessary tweaks
