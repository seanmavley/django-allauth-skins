Django All Auth Skins for bootstrapping my projects

I use Django-allauth a lot. I end up tweaking the UI for each project I work on. With this, using Material Design via the Materialize CSS Framework, I will only need to fix in the design into any project I work from now with the UI done in a basic, simplistic way.

Will be adding Foundation Zurb and Material Design Lite to the skins later.
